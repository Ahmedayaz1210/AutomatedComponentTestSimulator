# Automated Electronic Component Tester Simulator

## Overview
This C# project simulates an automated testing system for electronic components, demonstrating key concepts in test automation and software development for electronic testing equipment. It's designed to showcase programming skills relevant to Teradyne's product support and test engineering roles.

## Features
- Simulates testing of various electronic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors)
- Implements asynchronous testing to simulate parallel testing of multiple components
- Analyzes test results and provides a summary report
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and C# async/await pattern

## Requirements
- .NET 5.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or any C# compatible IDE)

## Usage
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
2. Build the project to resolve any dependencies.
3. Run the program.

The simulation will generate a batch of components, test them, and display the results including individual component measurements and an overall batch summary.

## Project Structure
- `Component`: Represents an electronic component with properties like type, nominal value, and tolerance.
- `Tester`: Main class that simulates the testing process and analyzes results.
- `Program`: Entry point of the application, sets up a sample batch of components and runs the test.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more complex testing algorithms for different component types
- Add a user interface for interactive testing and result visualization
- Integrate with simulated test equipment interfaces (e.g., virtual oscilloscope, DMM)
- Expand component types and testing parameters

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Proficiency in C# programming
- Understanding of asynchronous programming concepts
- Basic knowledge of electronic component testing principles
- Skills in data analysis and reporting in a testing context
